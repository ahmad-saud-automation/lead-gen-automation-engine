"""
runner.py — turn "a campaign" into "the exact leads this run will work on".

This is the piece V1 had no room for. V1 read a whole tab, filtered on Status alone,
took the first `max_firms`, and pushed them all to one campaign id. A run here instead:

    read the tab (raw rows)
        -> complete + validate the field map against the sheet's REAL header
        -> keep the rows this campaign's rules want
        -> drop anything the ledger already handled
        -> sort best-first
        -> cap by per_run, and by what is left of per_day
        -> organize into firms, carrying the raw row for the label table

Everything up to `organize` is pure and free, which is what makes `plan()` possible:
the same code path, stopped one step early, spending nothing.
