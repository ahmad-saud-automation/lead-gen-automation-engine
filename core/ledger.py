"""
ledger.py — the "already handled" record. SQLite, two stages, keyed on the sheet's own id.

Two V1 bugs are fixed here, and both were silent.

1. THE KEY.  V1 keyed on lowercased company name. The Eco sheet has 132 duplicate company
   names over 264 rows, so two different firms blocked each other forever. The key is now
   `row_key` — the sheet's `lead_id` — the same key n8n v8 write-back already switched to.

2. ENRICHED IS NOT PUSHED.  V1 put `email_found` in one TERMINAL set, so a lead that found
   an email but never reached Instantly was never looked at again. Harmless while there
   were no quotas; the moment a campaign caps at 50 a day it silently drops leads. There
   are now two stages, recorded separately:

       enrich  — we tried to find and verify an address. Do not spend on it twice.
       push    — it actually reached Instantly. Never send it again.

   A lead can be `enrich=email_found` and have no push row at all, which is exactly the
   state "found on Monday, quota ran out, still owed a send".

SQLite (not JSON) because two campaigns can now run at once, and two threads writing one
JSON file corrupts it.

⚠️ After fixing anything in the find-or-verify path, CLEAR THE LEDGER or the fix is
invisible — terminal outcomes are skipped forever and hide the improvement.
