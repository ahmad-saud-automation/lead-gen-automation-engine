REM
REM Two processes, one window:
REM   - the engine (Python) on 127.0.0.1:8771 - the sheet, the finders, the ledger
REM   - the screens (Next.js) on 127.0.0.1:3200 - what you look at
REM The browser only ever talks to 3200; Next passes /api through to 8771, so
REM nothing in the browser knows the engine's address. Close this window to
REM stop both.
REM
REM   start-app.bat           build the screens once if needed, then start
REM   start-app.bat rebuild   rebuild the screens first (after editing web\)
REM
REM The V1 interface is still at http://127.0.0.1:3200/legacy.

REM Heavy, regenerable folders must not sit in the Google Drive backup. Drive skips junctions.
REM The target MUST itself be called node_modules: Node follows the junction to the real path
REM and then walks UP looking for a folder named node_modules, so any other name breaks every
REM import with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND.
REM robocopy, not move: Google Drive holds a lock on files it is still syncing, and `move`
REM fails with "Access denied" on a fresh install. robocopy exit codes below 8 are success.
